# HRR
code for identifying homo- and heterozygosity patterns in high coverage whole genomes
modified from: https://github.com/ksolmundson/Runs_of_Homozygosity

Genome processing from raw reads through to BAM.

From BAM: Identify ROH with ROHan and process the results.

Filter and summarize ROHan outputs using Linux and then plot in R.
